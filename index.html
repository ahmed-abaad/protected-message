      <p>I have no words to say… but In simple terms… what you are feeling and going through rn is all bcoz of what you did to me… Wallahy i fell into depression bcoz of you last year… I had no one by my shoulder besides myself and Allah… I would cry all nights and not eat… Alhamdhulliah i made past that stage by myself while you were trying to hurt me more n more… i choose silence and suffered alone… Only Allah knows the pain that i suffered… See all this tym i was by myself while you left me in the dirt and busy enjoying the company of others… I remember choosing to build with you but now i am doing by myself… 
 Wallahy there is something called kifarah in Islam… The pain that i suffered… saa hii is what you are going through… you didn’t see my value by then but now you do… Wallahy I remember telling you that you will regret this and rn it’s clear you are in a thousands of regrets… 
I can tell you for sure i am okay by not having you by myside becoz I submitted to Allah’s qadar long tym ago… I swear upon Allah i will never reach out to you first to text you… I respect myself alot rn for what you did to me… If its ever meant to be and your intentions are pure you will come back and do the necessary but if your intentions are not pure Allah will still make you hold up and play your games trying to play with my feelings till HE blesses me with another girl… Trust you me if that happens just forget about me…  
Before you do anything jiketishe chini uamue wataka nini kataika maisha yako… I give you a whole week to think… Remember Allah made a promise that pure men are for pure women and vice versa… Wallah this is the last tym and chance you will ever hear from me again. Do not take advantage of my empathy.</p>
